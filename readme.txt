Installer for WiiGator's cMIOS (with MIOSv10 as base)

What is this?
This program patches the MIOS to allow booting of gamecube homebrew on a Wii and also patches the MIOS to enable DVD-R access. For gamecube homebrew and backups you need a loader that boots gamecube homebrew/boots gamecube games with a gamecube homebrew loader, for example NeoGamma R9.

Hint:
Get the required MIOS files as wad on sd card before starting HMP. You can easiliy download them with NUS Downloader
(see WiiBrew.org for download link). The expected name is:
RVL-mios-v10.wad


This application is based on PatchMii by bushing, svpe and tona
and also contains code from:
Raven's Menu Loader Clone (IOS selection code)
Waninkoko's WAD Manager (WAD code)
AnyTitleDeleter (TITLE_UPPER and TITLE_LOWER)
WiiGator's cMIOS installer(DVD-R and homebrew patch)

(please notify me if you find other code from other people inside this)
